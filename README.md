# Von Neumann Architecture Simulator

This app is a simulator to teach Von Neumann Architecture to students.

Created using React, shadcn/ui, and vite, this app was made to run fast, look good, and deploy easily.</br>
I made this to help myself understand how Von Neumann Architecture works on a low level.

<h2>📖 About the project</h2>
My VAA (my initials lol) Simulator was meant to provide an easy intuitive way to learn how VAA works, and the components that make up the architecture. It took me a long time to understand it, and I hope this project helps students after me understand it much more swiftly, with less pain. I hope to keep creating small projects like this to teach students, and make revision easier for everyone.
